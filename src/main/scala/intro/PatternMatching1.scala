  /**
   * Scala also has immutable classes, called case classes. You can use
   * pattern matching on them as well.
   *
   * The following case classes are used for the next functions.
   * Note that `OptionalNum` itself cannot be instantiated (as it is abstract):
   *  it's either `None`, indicating no value, or `Num(i)`, indicating a value.
   *
   * The keyword `sealed` indicates that ONLY the two case classes below can
   * be an OptionalNum. This can be used as a safety mechanism when checking
   * pattern matching. With `sealed` forgetting a case in the pattern match
   * will result in the compiler producing a non-exhaustive matching warning
   * without the keyword, this will not happen.
   *
   * Scala has similar built-in classes:
   * `Option`, extended by `None()` and `Some(v)`.
   * This is a very useful one, since instead of `null` in Java (and the
   * Exceptions that come with it), when something is not found for example
   * you can just return None without throwing an exception.
