    /**
      * Scala supports both `val`/`var` variables (There is actually one more type,
      * but that is outside of the scope of this course).
      * The difference is that once you assign a value to a `val` it cannot be
      * reassigned. If you would use `var` you can reassign its value though.
      * Functional Programming purists will consider var as blasphemy, but Scala
      * is a bit more pragmatic supporting both imperative programming with vars
      * and mutability as well as the functional style with `val`s and
      * immutability. Within this lab assignment you are *NOT* allowed to use
      * `var` to help speed up the functional programming learning process.
      *
      * Instead of the above method body between braces you could also write more
      * minimalistic:
      *
      * 		def simpleMath(i: Int) = i * 5 + 2
      *
      * The above expression can also be defined as an anonymous function and
      * assigned to a variable, i.e. the anonymous function (or lambda or lambda
      * expression as it is also called) can be written as follows:
      *
      * 		(i: Int) => i * 5 + 2
      *
      * This can be assigned to a variable called simpleMath by:
      *
      * 		val simpleMath = (i: Int) => i * 5 + 2
      *
      * So from this example you see that defining an anonymous function is done
      * by first supplying the input parameters between () separated by commas,
      * followed by a '=>', ending with the method body.
      *
      * You can apply such a function for example to a list by supplying it to
      * methods that take a function as input parameter. Be careful of the
      * correct function signature or else your compiler/interpreter/IDE
      * will complain.
      *
      * Example usage:
      * 		List(22,34,48).map(increaseGrade) // results in List(112, 172, 242)
      *
      * This example takes our lambda and applies it to each element of the list
      * It works because:
      * 		1. List.map takes a function as input parameter
      * 		2. final def map[B](f: (A) => B): List[B] is the function signature
      *		       of map. It takes a function (A) => B, a function which takes a
      * 		   type A element, does something to it, and returns a type B.
      *		       Our anonymous function is of type Int => Int, so this works.

    //		// - Look up the List functions used in the Scala API
    //		// - change the parameter type of f in both HOFS below
    //		//   from ...... to the correct type
    // - then uncomment this block and remove the `???`

    /* Note 1
     * running println(hofs()) results in
     * List(List(2,4), List(1,3), List(20,22,24,26,28,30))
     *
     * It is also good for you to see that you can define methods within methods
     * (if you ever need helper methods but do not want the outer world to see,
     * use this technique, i.e. it does more or less the same as defining a
     * private helper function and calling that from with the method body)
     */

    /* Note 2:
     * As you can see from inspecting the function signature of `hofs`
     * it takes no input parameters and returns a List of List[Int]
     *
     * You don't need to specify the return type, except for recursive
     * functions; Scala will infer most return types for you. It is however good
     * practice to specify the return type when defining the function signature.
     * If you read another person's code without reading the whole method body,
     * having the complete function signature including return type is a hint to
     * its inner workings. Also, when debugging, it can really help you to view
     * the function as a blackbox with input/output types, so supplying the
     * return type has good benefits.
