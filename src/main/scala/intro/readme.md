This part of the assignment gives a brief introduction into the Scala language. 
All 4 parts together give you 40 points.

1. (3p) Learn how to implement functions [here](<Functions.scala>). 
2. (3p) Learn how lists work and how to operate on them [here](<Lists.scala>).
3. (4p) Learn about pattern matching [here](<PatternMatching1.scala>).
4. (14p) Learn about advanced pattern matching [here](<PatternMatching2.scala>).
5. (16p) Practice your newly gained knowledge [here](<Practice.scala>).

Implement all functions yourself, i.e. do not use library functions (except Q2).
