     * The following method shows a bit more challenging example. It is supposed 
     * to represent the method to determine whether a driver will receive a fine 
     * when crossing a traffic light. When the light is green, or when it is 
     * orange and the time passed since crossing is less than or equal to three 
     * seconds passed the driver will not receive a fine. When it is red or 
     * more than three seconds after the light changed to orange, the driver 
     * will receive a fine.
     * 
     * The return type will indicate whether the driver gets a fine, and what 
     * the reason is, as a String. This tuple, i.e. (true or false, reasoning) 
     * will also indicate if the traffic light is malfunctioning. Take a look
     * below for the complete example.
